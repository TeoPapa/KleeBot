# KleeBot
KleeBot is a prototype Discord bot programmed in JDA. It creates a Discord Bot that imitates Klee from the famous game Genshin Impact.

The Bot is still far from ready. A plethora of bugs must be solved, broken (for the moment) parts and many more must be implemented before this Bot is considered ready.

(Note: This project, as mentioned earlier, is nothing but the imitation of the character Klee and is not for profitable use. It was made as a personal Bot for private servers and by no means should be used in gain of money. Klee is a character owned by her respectful creators MiHoYo (Hoyoverse) )
